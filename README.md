# FriendFinder
Find a friend who's compatible with you. 

FriendFiner is a full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users in order to find the best match. The app displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing. This app is available on this Heroku link.
